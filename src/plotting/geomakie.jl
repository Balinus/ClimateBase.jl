"""
    climplot(A::ClimArray; kwargs...) â†’ fig, ax, el, cb

Main plotting function that dispatches to [`climscatter!`](@ref) if `A` has
an [`CoordinateSpace`](@ref) dimension, or to [`climsurface!`](@ref) for [`OrthogonalSpace`](@ref).

Return the figure, axis, plotted element, and colorbar.

Optionally you can provide keyword `scatter = true` to force using the scatterplot.

Plotting from ClimateBase.jl also works with `Observable`s that enclose a `ClimArray`.
You can update the values of the observable with another `ClimArray` with the same spatial
dimension, and the plot will be updated. See documentation online for examples.
